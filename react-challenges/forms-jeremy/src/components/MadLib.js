// Challenge: Mad Libs
// As a developer, I have been tasked with recreating the children's game Mad Libs as an app. Mad Libs requires the user to supply a series of random words that match the part of speech as indicated. When all the words have been supplied, the user can see their words added to a pre-written story. Hilarity ensues.

// Mad Libs

// As a user, I can see a page with many text inputs.
// As a user, I can see labels next to the text inputs indicating what part of speech (or type of word) should be entered into each text form: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adjectives.
// As a user, I can fill out the inputs.
// As a user, after I have filled out the text inputs I can click a 'Submit' button.
// As a user, when I click 'Submit' I see a paragraph appear on the page that contains the words I entered in the text forms to create a funny story.
