// Challenge: Listening Robot
// Active Listening Robot Challenge

// As a user, I can see a page with a text input.
// As a developer, I have one parent component that holds state (logic or smart component).
// As a developer, I have an input in my parent component.
// As a user, I see titles of three robots waiting for my text.
// As a developer, I have three child components that do not hold state (display or dumb component).
// As a user, when I enter text I see the three robots responses update in real time.
// As a developer, I can call an onChange method on the input tag.
// As a developer, I can pass the updated state as props to the child components.
// As a developer, I can see the child components display the user input.
// As a user, I see my "Good Robot" repeating exactly what I type.
// As a user, I see my "Bad Robot" saying BLABLA.... One character for every character I type.
// As a developer, I can create modification to the user input text by creating a method in my child component.
// As a user, I see a third robot that is the developer's choice.
